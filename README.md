# Fuel-Efficiency-Prediction
The "Fuel Efficiency Prediction" project utilizes the Auto MPG dataset to predict a car’s fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (MPG), based on features including the number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin. Fuel efficiency, an important indicator of a vehicle’s economy and environmental impact, varies across vehicles due to these attributes.
